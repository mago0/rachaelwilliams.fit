          <p>"Before starting with Rachael I didn’t know how to do certain exercises. Also, I didn’t know the correct timing to do cardio/weight lifting.  She helped me successfully do the exercises I was hesitant about and formed a doable workout plan that includes cardio and weight lifting so I don’t have to wonder which one to do. She also always answers quickly whenever I have questions about the workouts. I can now successfully do a deadlift and a squat.  I have gained muscle, become stronger, and have gained confidence in what I can do."</p>

          <p>"I didn’t have any reservations before we started working together but my knee flexibility was very poor, I was willing to try anything.  Rachael walked me through what I needed to do and showed me how simple it could be to improve flexibility and help my knees in the long run.  The plan is very simple, but the improvements it has made have been amazing.  I now have improved knee flexibility, my squat form has improved drastically, and knee pain has significantly decreased."</p>

          <p>"I was looking forward to working with Rachael because of my experience in her SilverSneakers classes.  Her positive attitude and smiling face is great.  Her energetic personality is a motivational force for me.  My top two goals when we started were to improve my balance and strengthen my back.  I now have better balance and am stronger!"</p>
