      <h2>About Rachael</h2>
      <p>
        I am a wife, mom, athlete, and movement junkie. A certified professional trainer for over a decade, my interests have been varied but they all boil down to the ability to move and move well.

        I believe in the importance of feeling strong, mobile, and confident in your body so you can pursue your passions, tackle your challenges, and enjoy your life to the fullest.
