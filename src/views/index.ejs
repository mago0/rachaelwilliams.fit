                    Before starting with Rachael I didn’t know how to do certain
                    exercises. Also, I didn’t know the correct timing to do
                    cardio/weight lifting. She helped me successfully do the exercises I
                    was hesitant about and formed a doable workout plan that includes
                    cardio and weight lifting so I don’t have to wonder which one to do.
                    She also always answers quickly whenever I have questions about the
                    workouts. I can now successfully do a deadlift and a squat. I have
                    gained muscle, become stronger, and have gained confidence in what I
                    can do.

                    I didn’t have any reservations before we started working together
                    but my knee flexibility was very poor, I was willing to try
                    anything. Rachael walked me through what I needed to do and showed
                    me how simple it could be to improve flexibility and help my knees
                    in the long run. The plan is very simple, but the improvements it
                    has made have been amazing. I now have improved knee flexibility, my
                    squat form has improved drastically, and knee pain has significantly
                    decreased.

                    I was looking forward to working with Rachael because of my
                    experience in her SilverSneakers classes. Her positive attitude and
                    smiling face is great. Her energetic personality is a motivational
                    force for me. My top two goals when we started were to improve my
                    balance and strengthen my back. I now have better balance and am
                    stronger!"
